# F14: Corrigendum

F14 is about changes to the *notice*. The [Instructions for the use of the standard form 14 "Corrigendum" (F14)](http://simap.ted.europa.eu/documents/10184/166101/Instructions+for+the+use+of+F14_EN.pdf/909e4b38-1871-49a1-a206-7a5976a2d262) describe:

* "F14 is used for announcing small changes. Please note that if there are significant changes, the notice should be republished."
* "F14 is no longer used to inform about incomplete or unsuccessful procedures. This is done by using the contract award notice."

Going further, the European Commission in its [eForms consultation](https://github.com/eForms/eForms) proposes to republish notices – adding a short section to summarize and justify the change – instead of using F14 at all ([see discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/72)). As such, we omit guidance for F14.
