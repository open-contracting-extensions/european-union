# F20: Modification notice

F20 is about modifications to the *contract* or *concession*.

Similar to [F14](../F14), the European Commission proposes in its [eForms consultation](https://github.com/eForms/eForms) to republish notices – adding a short section to summarize and justify the modification – instead of using F20. As such, we omit guidance for F20 ([see discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/45)).
